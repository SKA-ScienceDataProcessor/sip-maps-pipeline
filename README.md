SDP Integration Prototype (SIP) Pipeline
========================================

This is a project to create a pipeline for SIP to process spectropolarimetric LOFAR data.

Notes
-----

This initial code is in continuous development, and currently provides limited functionality. 

Primary use at this time includes full-Stokes imaging and Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) Synthesis of data from the Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) All-Sky Polarisation Survey (MAPS) with LOFAR.

Additional features that are intended to be implemented are commented at the appropriate places in the code.
